## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-10%2022-01-40.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Div
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Today, I learned two essential web development skills: how to center a div element both horizontally and vertically, and how to make an image perfectly fit within a div container.

## Centering a div Horizontally and Vertically:

To center a div both horizontally and vertically, I discovered two effective techniques:

Using Flexbox: I can employ Flexbox by wrapping my content inside a container div and applying some straightforward CSS. By setting display: flex, justify-content: center (for horizontal alignment), and align-items: center (for vertical alignment), I can effortlessly center the div content within the viewport. Optionally, I can use height: 100vh to make the container occupy the full height of the viewport.

Using Grid: Alternatively, I can center a div by using CSS Grid. This method involves setting display: grid and place-items: center within the container's styles. Similar to Flexbox, this approach centers the content both horizontally and vertically within the viewport. Again, I can add height: 100vh for full viewport height if needed.

## Making an Image Fit a div Container:

I also learned how to make an image fit snugly within a div container:

To achieve this, I can specify the desired width and height for the container, giving it the dimensions I want. Additionally, I set overflow: hidden to ensure any parts of the image that exceed the container's boundaries are hidden from view.

For the image itself, I simply set max-width and max-height to 100%. This instructs the image to adapt its size to fit perfectly within the container, maintaining its original aspect ratio. I also use display: block to remove any default spacing around the image.

By mastering these techniques, I can now confidently center div elements and control image resizing to fit div containers in my web development projects.

### Continued development

In the future I will want to use react.js and make it more responsive.
